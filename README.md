# Pizza_sales_Product_Analysis
📝 Project Overview: This project involves comprehensive analysis of a pizza sales dataset using structured SQL queries to derive business insights. The goal was to understand customer ordering patterns, sales performance, and product popularity, which can support strategic business decisions for a pizza chain.

🚩 Business Problem:
The pizza company lacked clarity on what drives their sales—there was no deep insight into customer preferences, peak ordering times, or product-wise performance. This was affecting inventory management, marketing efforts, and profitability.

🎯 Objectives:
To solve the business problem, the following key questions were addressed:
1.	How many total orders were placed?
2.	What was the total revenue from pizza sales?
3.	Which is the highest-priced pizza?
4.	Which pizza size is most commonly ordered?
5.	What are the top 5 most frequently ordered pizza types?
6.	How many pizzas were sold per category?
7.	When are the peak hours for orders?
8.	How are different pizzas distributed across categories?
9.	What is the average number of pizzas ordered per day?
10.	Which are the top 3 pizzas by revenue?
11.	What is each pizza's contribution percentage to total revenue?
12.	What is the trend of cumulative revenue over time?
